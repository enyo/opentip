Opentip
=======

[Opentip][opentip] is a free opensource Java-Script tooltip class.


Features
--------

It supports:

- Stems (little pointers)
- Automatic content download with [AJAX][ajax]
- Different styles
- Automatic repositioning of the tooltip if it's not in the viewport of the browser anymore
- All kind of triggers (The tooltip can be triggered by mouse over, click, form submit,... everything you can think of really)
- CSS3 Animations
- Well tested, with over 200 unit tests

As of Version 2.0 Opentip does **no longer depend on [Prototype]**. You can choose
*any* adapter you want so you can work with the framework of your choice.

Supported frameworks are:

- Native. You can use this one if you don't use any framework.
- [Ender]
- [Component]
- [jQuery]
- [Prototype]

### Build status

Master [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enyo/opentip.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/enyo/opentip)  

Develop [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enyo/opentip.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/enyo/opentip) 


Installation
------------

### jQuery, Prototype, Native

Just download `lib/opentip.js` and `lib/adapter.FRAMEWORK.js` and include them
in this order. You can also take the already minified and combined files in the
`downloads/` folder.

### Component

The easiest and recommended way to install *opentip* is with [component]. Just
add `enyo/opentip` as dependency in your `component.json` and rebuild it.

Simply requiring opentip then activates the tooltips: `require "opentip";`


### Ender

If you prefer [ender] as package manager just install it like this:

```bash
$ ender build opentip
```

### Bower

Another package manager supported is [bower]:

```bash
$ bower install opentip
```

* * *

You should include opentip's CSS as well. It's in `css/opentip.css`. (Except
for [component] of course which automatically bundles the css.)

* * *

If you want to work it with <=IE8, you have to include excanvas as well. Please
refer to the [installation guide](http://www.opentip.org/installation.html).

Usage
-----

*Version 2.4.5*

With HTML data attributes:

```html
<div data-ot="Tooltip content" data-ot-show-on="click">Click me</div>
```

or with the Javascript API:

```js
$('elementId').opentip('Content', { showOn: "click", ...options... });
```

For the complete documentation please visit [www.opentip.org][opentip].


Future plans
------------

- ~~Become library independant. I'm currently working on
  extracting all prototype functionality, so I can switch library easily. The
  next library   I'll support will be jquery, and then mootools.~~

- Add more skins.

- ~~Add cooler loading animation.~~

- ~~Implement unit tests.~~


If you have ideas, please contact me!

Migrating from Opentip 1.x to 2.x
---------------------------------

Those are the major changes you should look out for when migrating from 1.x to 2.x:

- There's no `Tip` or `Tips` object anymore. Everything is done through
  `Opentip`

- The recommend way to create opentips now is to call
  `new Opentip(element, content, title, options)`, or with the framework of
  your choice (eg, [ender]: `$("#my-div").opentip(content, title options)`)

- The instantiation of new tips inside an event (eg: `onclick`, `onmouseover`)
  is no   longer supported! This would create new opentips everytime the event
  is fired.

- `Opentip.debugging = true;` does no longer exist. Use `Opentip.debug = true;`

- Positions are no longer of the weird form `[ "left", "top" ]` but simply
  strings   like `"top left"` or `"right"`

- `stem.size` has been dropped in favor of `stem.length` and `stem.base`

- Most of the design is now done in JS since the whole thing is a canvas now.

- The way close buttons are defined has completely changed. Please refer to the
  docs for more information.
